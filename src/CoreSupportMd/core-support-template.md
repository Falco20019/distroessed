## Supported versions

Specific versions of the Core only natively support specific versions of .NET. Backwards compatability is only tested if marked explicitly!

### First level targets

These are the platforms that the Core actively targets, is tested against and offers full support on.

PLACEHOLDER-FIRST-LEVEL-TARGETS

### Second level targets

These are the platforms that the Core could run on but is (currently) not actively tested on. Most of these are relevant for Docker and could become become first level targets in the future. Support is given on a per-request base.

PLACEHOLDER-SECOND-LEVEL-TARGETS

### Third level targets

These are the platforms that the Core could run on but are not considered relevant at the moment. These might become first or second level targets in the future. No support is given.

PLACEHOLDER-THIRD-LEVEL-TARGETS

### Non targets

These are platforms we technically could support through .NET but are not testing or might even need special handling. Usage is neither recommended nor supported.

PLACEHOLDER-NON-TARGETS

## Out of support versions

Support for the following versions was ended by the distribution owners and are [no longer supported by .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/os-lifecycle-policy.md) and therefore also dropped by the Core.
